description: "Tom Brown's School Days (sometimes written Tom Brown's Schooldays, also\
  \ published under the titles Tom Brown at Rugby, School Days at Rugby, and Tom Brown's\
  \ School Days at Rugby) is an 1857 novel by Thomas Hughes. The story is set in the\
  \ 1830s at Rugby School, a public school for boys. Hughes attended Rugby School\
  \ from 1834 to 1842.\nThe novel was originally published as being \"by an Old Boy\
  \ of Rugby\", and much of it is based on the author's experiences. Tom Brown is\
  \ largely based on the author's brother George Hughes. George Arthur, another of\
  \ the book's main characters, is generally believed to be based on Arthur Penrhyn\
  \ Stanley. The fictional Tom's life also resembles the author's, in that the culminating\
  \ event of his school career was a cricket match. The novel also features Dr Thomas\
  \ Arnold (1795â€“1842), who was the actual headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to\
  \ 1841.\nTom Brown's School Days has been the source for several film and television\
  \ adaptations. It also influenced the genre of British school novels, which began\
  \ in the 19th century, and led to fictional depictions of schools such as Billy\
  \ Bunter's Greyfriars School, Mr Chips' Brookfield, St. Trinian's, and Harry Potter's\
  \ Hogwarts. A sequel, Tom Brown at Oxford, was published in 1861.\n From Wikipedia\
